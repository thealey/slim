Trying to get a little more fit.

The hacker diet is real good for me. http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/

The Withings body scale.. also great. Glad I bought it. http://www.withings.com/en/bodyscale

I just made a thing that.. you can add weight measures yourself or else hook it to your scale..

This tells you, are you doing the right thing or off track. Help you get slimmer. Is all.
