INSERT INTO `posts` VALUES (1,'Cinsulin','EDIT: I am already laying off the cinsulin. The short term effect was great but in the long run not sure..\r\n\r\n\r\n<center><img width=\'200\' src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SNt86jgvL._SL500_AA300_.jpg\"></center>\r\n\r\nI was interested in cinnamon\'s effect of smoothing out blood sugar over time.\r\n\r\nThat said I had zero interest in walking around with sticks of saigon cinnamon and a micro zester.\r\n\r\nI am not really a fan of cinnamon and the thought of sprinkling it on my food is not appealing.\r\n\r\n[Cinsulin](http://www.amazon.com/Trunature-CinSulin-Cinnamon-Chromium-Picolinate/dp/B002EN0ZMO) seems to be very effective for me.\r\n\r\nThe [manufacturer\'s page](http://trunature.net/products/cinsulin-cinnamon-extract-chromium-picolinate-120-capsules) does have me concerned though. Who is that person pointing at the bottle?! Plus a warning it does popups to get you to buy stuff. It seems to be like Costco\'s house brand so hopefully Costco can be trusted.\r\n\r\nIt\'s a pill which is good, basically no cinnamon taste or effects. I spiked to my lowest weight two days after starting it. It\'s cheap. It seems to be if you believe the marketing more cinnamon than you could reasonably eat and refined in some way.\r\n\r\nEarly days just saying.\r\n',1,'2011-08-07 13:58:40','2011-08-12 01:19:36'),(3,'General weight loss approach - in progress','## Introduction\r\n\r\nThis is the shortest writeup I can make about my approach to be slim.\r\n\r\nI hope to refine it over time.\r\n\r\nIt\'s likely some of the results or lack thereof are specific to me, of course.\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n\r\n* [Withings](http://www.withings.com/en/bodyscale)\r\n* [Hacker Diet](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/)\r\n* [Four Hour Body (4hb)](http://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Body-Uncommon-Incredible-Superhuman/dp/030746363X)\r\n* [South beach diet](http://www.amazon.com/South-Beach-Diet-Delicious-Doctor-Designed/dp/1579546463)\r\n* [Libra](http://code.google.com/p/libra-android/)\r\n* [Slim](http://slim.flunkyism.com/)\r\n\r\n## Measurement\r\n\r\nThis is maybe the most important thing to me.\r\n\r\nGenerally I\'ve had very little to go on in terms of being aware of where my weight was going.\r\n\r\nHaving this trend data is I think critical. Otherwise you are flying blind.\r\n\r\nThe [signal to noise](http://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4/signalnoise.html) section of the hacker diet was extremely helpful for me.\r\n\r\nThe idea is basically you lose and gain weight on a daily basis that is water weight. This can be a huge distraction where you think you are doing poorly or well but the daily data can be largely random. Much more useful to focus on a weighted moving average than each daily weight which is very misleading.\r\n\r\nThe Withings scale works well to keep you honest and minimize friction. That said inputting daily weight manually - it\'s not hard either.\r\n\r\nYou definitely have to weigh every day to know what is what.\r\n\r\n## Exercise\r\n\r\nLong and short of it, I\'m with the hacker diet.\r\n\r\nIt\'s a great thing to work out, if you are stronger and have solid cardio ability you live longer and are happier.\r\n\r\nThat said working out has little to do with your weight. Your weight is mainly about what you eat.\r\n\r\nI don\'t do 4HB \"air squats\" or whatnot. Maybe someday.\r\n\r\nMy workout that said is all kettlebells which I love. Totally sold on the efficiency of them. Two hand swing with proper form 3x a week, done. Back pain gone for me.\r\n\r\n## Supplements\r\n\r\nI am not a big pill person so it\'s hard to accept that supplements help but yes they sure as hell do.\r\n\r\nI have two approaches. One is 4HB PAGG stack. That works for me. I\'d give it a B.\r\n\r\nI also do a different one I made up I\'d give an A-. It\'s 3 [fiber](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013OW2KS/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=B001A5ZCY8&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=1PKJ0DSF9BKCAXB4S9YK), 1 [cinsulin](http://www.cinsulin.com/) in the morning. Then 3 fiber, 1 cinsulin, 1 [chromium picolinate](http://www.costco.com/Browse/Product.aspx?Prodid=11618272) at dinner. I don\'t have much for a rationale for why that works but it does for me.\r\n\r\n## Diet\r\n\r\nI do basically the south beach diet. Basically no carbs, no fruit no sugar no bread no chips no fried foods. I do allow liquid carbs is my cheat, beer and wine.\r\n\r\nI tried simple calorie not carb counting and this failed miserably for me. If i reduce carbs I lose weight simple as that.\r\n\r\nI don\'t do legumes.. splurge days.. lemon.. Any of that. Maybe some day not so far.\r\n\r\n## Cold\r\n\r\n4HB has a thing about cold.. cold showers and ice baths. Which sounds disturbing. \r\n\r\nThe workaround is to put an ice pack at the base of the neck for 20 minutes a day. \r\n\r\nIt sounds like it shouldn\'t work to me but it actually does and well. By which I mean if you are losing weight at .5lbs a week the ice pack will buy you another .2 - .4 lbs a week which is meaningful. And in the summer the cold pack is not for me unpleasant at all.\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\nFor me doing the above means .5 lbs lost per week is the minimum. You have to be somewhat patient.. it takes time in any case but if you are not getting 1/2 lb a week then something is wrong. You are maybe eating too much.\r\n\r\nThe best I\'ve been able to do without any Christian Bale heroics is around 1 lb  lost / month. That for me is approaching best case. Which is fine.\r\n',1,'2011-08-09 01:51:14','2011-08-09 16:55:42'),(4,'Binge day?','Probably my personality but I dont want to splurge and eat a pizza.\r\n\r\n4HB recommends one day a week you eat whatever you want.. in part to feel better in part to like switch up your metabolism and mix up your body so it does not get so used to the slow / low carb deal.\r\n\r\nI am reluctant to do this, it feels undisciplined and undoing my progress.\r\n\r\nI might try not a whole splurge day.. but at least one meal? I might eat carbs once per week for dinner. If my trend line says stop I sure will.\r\n\r\nThanks Bill Huschle for the feedback.',1,'2011-08-12 01:24:54','2011-08-12 01:25:09'),(5,'Kettlebells','What is the best starting weight and number of reps / sets?

Where 4HB says once a week eat whatever you want. Mix things up on yourself and recharge the metabolism and I dont really even remember the logic. Something to try though.\r\n\r\nA whole binge day.. scared me too much but I figured one meal would be ok.\r\n\r\nSo Friday night I had 3 smallish pieces of pizza at <a href=\"http://www.caffetoscahingham.com/\">Caffe Tosca</a> in Hingham.

I don\'t know yet is that going to be a positive long term thing or what.\r\n\r\nAlso I went on cinsulin, and I noticed quite a bit less daily variance in my weight.\r\n\r\nLike all of a sudden you pull 4 straight days where you deviate up or down less than half a pound.\r\n\r\nWhereas before it was commonplace moving 2 lbs every day up or down for the trend line to average out for you.\r\n\r\nThat is interesting and somewhat unexpected for me.. but it does seem to be pretty reliable.\r\n\r\nSo I think Cinsulin is for me a way to maintain a target weight maybe? Not for sure but my best guess right now.\r\n\r\nI am going to discontinue Cinsulin for a few weeks and see if variance returns.\r\n\r\nMy aspirational goal is 190.. and I\'d still like to work towards that. The reality is under 200 for me is pretty good though. As long as my trend weight is under 200 I feel pretty good about changing things just to see what happens.\r\n\r\nAlso I started going the air squats etc. Not sure if that will have a measurable impact.',1,'2011-08-24 11:17:19','2011-08-24 11:17:19'),(10,'Costco supplement marketing','is <a href=\"http://www.costco.com/Browse/Product.aspx?Prodid=11533605&cm_mmc=BCEmail_664-_-FOCUS-_-17-_-MarketingItemName\">pretty good</a>\r\n\r\nPDF is very 4hb.\r\n\r\nI\'ve never been close to 2lbs / week other than first week starting low carb which is normal.',1,'2011-08-24 23:58:51','2011-08-25 00:00:49');
